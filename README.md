# HiddenListForm
My example to have a multi-value, searchable form that allows a dropdown to appear with filtered 
search results based on what is typed.  Each item can be added as a hidden input, visible to the
user as a tag with a cancel button.  Submitting the form submits each related tag to the associated
name - so you can submit a dynamic list of values all with the same input name, and the user can
clearly see what is and isn't being submitted.

### Dependencies:
I am using the following open-source projects in the completion of this project.  The files that 
use them expect them to be in the relative `js/ and `css/` files respectively:
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
